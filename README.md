This is a little app that helps you build grocery list by combining items for you.

Hacking on this
---------------

To get set up:

1. make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed
2. `cd` inside
3. `npm install`

Once you're set up:

* `npm start` starts a development server
* `npm run build` builds all the files to `public/`
* `npm test` runs the tests once
* `npm run test:watch` runs the tests while you work
